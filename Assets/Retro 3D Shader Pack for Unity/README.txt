- Copied and shared 
- Adapted, remixed, and transformed for any purpose, including commercial
Under the condition that:
- It must be appropriately credited to the original creator and a link to the above license provided
- If you adapt, remix, or transform the material it must be distributed under the same license as the original
These conditions only apply when the pack itself or a modified version is being distributed - they do not apply to games and other products built using the pack as a tool.

It should be noted that the pack is freely available under a pay-what-you-want model on itch.io - although you can distribute it freely, I'd rather you provide a link to the page on which it's available so that users have the option to compensate me for my work if they want.

If you find an issue or have any feedback, let me know via Twitter or email - additionally, if you make something using this pack I'd love to know about it!



Installation:
The post-processing shader included in the pack requires Unity's Post-Processing Stack system (https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack.html). To install the current version (v2) of the Post-Processing Stack:
- Open the Package Manager via the 'Window' menu at the top of the screen
- Wait for the list of available packages to load, select 'Post-Processing', and press 'Import' 



How To Use:
All non-post-processing shaders included in the package can be used once the folder has been imported into a Unity project. To apply one of these shaders to a material:
- Select the material in the project window
- Click the drop-down Shader menu at the top of the top of the Inspector window
- Select 'Retro 3D Shader Pack/<preferred shader>

See the 'Setting up the post-processing stack' page (https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack-SetUp.html) on how to configure a scene to use the retro post-processing shader. You can use the supplied retro post-processing profile included with the Example Scene or create your own if you want to include extra post-processing effects.
